# House of DWD — Historical and Textual Context

This document provides academically recognized background information related 
to the historical “House of David” (Byt Dwd) and associated biblical references. 
It is included for contextual awareness only and does not affect any technical 
functionality of the SOVERAIN‑QR demo repository.

## 1. Archaeological Reference: “House of David” (Byt Dwd)

Archaeological inscriptions such as the Tel Dan Stele contain the term 
“BYTDWD,” widely understood by scholars as “House of David,” identifying 
a Judahite royal dynasty associated with Jerusalem. This reference is 
recognized in mainstream academic literature as evidence of a historical 
Davidic line.

---

## 2. Textual Reference: The Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7)

Biblical scholarship describes 2 Samuel 7 as outlining a covenant in which 
God establishes the continuity of David’s lineage. Academic commentary 
typically frames this as a theological promise within the biblical narrative, 
not a contractual ownership claim by David.

---

## 3. Textual Reference: Resource Ownership (1 Chronicles 29:14–16)

In the Chronicler’s account, David acknowledges that the resources gathered 
for the Temple—gold, silver, bronze, iron, and wood—are considered to belong 
to God. This passage is often cited in theological studies to illustrate 
the biblical theme of divine ownership of material resources.
